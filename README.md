This repository is meant to ensure repeatability and replicabilty of our work.

Files `data_bees.xlsx` and `data_vegetation.xlsx` contains data, data analysis is available in file `DataAnalysis.R` and sampling site selection procedure will soon be available at `SiteSelection.R`. However, georeferenced vector data is not provided here due to the file size - it is available at https://data.gov.lv/dati/eng/dataset/meza-valsts-registra-meza-dati (we used a version of the data from year 2022).
